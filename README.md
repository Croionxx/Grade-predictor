# Grade Predictor

## Problem Statement

### Title: AI-Based Grade Prediction
<br>
Description:
<br>
Build a model to predict a studentâ€™s final grade based on features such as
attendance, participation, assignment scores, and exam marks.
Dataset:
Use the Student Performance Dataset or synthesize a similar dataset. You are
free to search for and use better datasets.
<br>
Deliverables:
<br>
1. Train an ANN or Decision Tree model for regression or classification.<br>
2. Evaluate using RMSE or classification metrics (e.g., accuracy, F1-score).<br>
3. Analyze feature importance to identify key contributors to performance.<br>
<br>
Bonus (Productization):<br>
Build a web app ( Streamlit is fine ) where users can input student details to
predict grades.
